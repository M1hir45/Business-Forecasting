Iâ€™m currently working on a project in the field of Business Forecasting.
We are forecasting demand for a subset of hair care products that are sourced from a distribution center in Whittier, CA. The distribution leads need an accurate forecast to adequately and effectively plan labor for the upcoming months.
The desired output of the forecast will help plan labor for the first half of 2022 (Jan-Jun 2022).
Forecast accuracy will be measured by the metric Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). MASE will help us in determining if we are under forecasting or over forecasting for the data set as we need the forecast to be very accurate.
The data set is 5 years of historical demand for the subset of haircare products. The time dimension is broken out by year, month, week, day. Simulation data was provided by the marketing team in order to complete this case study.
The github profile of my colleagues working on the project with me are as follows: Travis - https://github.com/TJMcDougal/Business-Forecasting , Anvay - https://github.com/Anvayg1/BusinessForecasting
